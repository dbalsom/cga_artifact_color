# CGA Artifact Color Decoder
Decodes NTSC composite artifact color from CGA RGBI image data. This is not a full NTSC simulation.

CGA images are encoded into the output of the color generation circuit of the CGA based on the original schematic published in the IBM Personal Computer AT Technical Reference, First Edition (1984). That quasi-composite output is then sampled for luma and chroma signals.
